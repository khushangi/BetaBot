Hi,I am Anup Savaliya presenting you the project BetaBot.It is a python based telegram quizbot which can give quizzes according to users wish.It provides that much questions which a user want to answer.It also shows whether the answer is correct or not.It uses API of trivia website to fetch questions.Due to shortage of time,the result function is not working properly but will be added soon.Also the genre of quizzes feature will be added soon that allows user to choose the genres of their quiz.Multiple users can take quiz on it which allows them to compare themselves also.
